# New York City Neighborhood Transformation and Development
### JC Soliman, Emmy Kuo & Michana Pubien 

The New York City real estate market is an immensely complex environment that is constantly changing and developing. Predicting the next up & coming neighborhood could mean turning a huge profit, while a small misstep could mean huge losses. 

With the passing of an increased 'Mansion Tax', activity in the condo market has slowed. Additionally, the passing of the "Housing Stability & Tenant Protections Act" this past June has not only subjected rent stabilized multifamily properties to increased regulatory burdens, but also effectively disincentivized investment. Multifamily properties that are not subject to rent stabilization have also been affected by the law. 

Activity in Manhattan experienced the lowest third quarter sales since 2009, reported Corcoran. The median sale price fell by 8% while the mean sale price fell by 12%. It has become increasingly necessary to look to other boroughs and neighborhoods for development opportunities.



## **Our Approach**

Before making any predictions or recommendations, we first constructed an accurate snapshot of NYC neighborhoods and explored the growth trends in those neighborhoods. Then we developed a criteria to rank the neighborhoods by how suitable they are for investment. Finally, we looked at how well the models coincided with indicators in current policy.

## **What factors are important?**

We decided to look at three main factors that make up a neighborhood: people, place and policy. Based on relative importance and the availability of data we chose the following variables to study.

**People** \
Income data from the IRS \
Crime data from the NYPD 

**Place** \
Sales Data from NYC Department of Finance \
Development data from NYC Department of Buildings

**Policy** \
Opportunity Zones set by the NYC Empire State Development

## **How did we combine the selected variables?**

One of the main challenges is to organize the data from these 5 disparate sources. Each dataset comes from a different governement entity, in different formats, use different indices & identifying information and were often inconsistent through the years.
